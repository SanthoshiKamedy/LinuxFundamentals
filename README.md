Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) heads the family that includes CentOS, CentOS Stream, Fedora and Oracle Linux.
# RED HAT
Fedora has a close relationship with RHEL and contains significantly more software than Red Hat's enterprise version. One reason for this is that a diverse community is involved in building Fedora, with many contributors who do not work for Red Hat. Furthermore, it is used as a testing platform for future RHEL releases.

We will use CentOS Stream and CentOS more often for activities, demonstrations, and labs because there is no cost to the end user, and there is a longer release cycle than for Fedora (which releases a new version every six months or so).

The basic version of CentOS is also virtually identical to RHEL, the most popular Linux distribution in enterprise environments. However, CentOS 8 has no scheduled updates after 2021. The replacement is CentOS 8 Stream. The difference between the two versions is CentOS Stream gets updates before RHEL, while CentOS gets them after. For most purposes this matters very little and not at all for this course. While there are alternatives to CentOS Stream that look more like the older CentOS, for this course we find CentOS 8 Stream works just fine.
